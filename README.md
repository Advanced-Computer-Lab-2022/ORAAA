## Project Description
This is a worldwide **Online Learning Platform** where anyone could sign up and watch prerecorded courses. The purpose of this web application is to create an organized studying system that is easy to navigate. This platform does not only include the recorded courses but also content-based quizzes.

## Installations
We used the **MERN Stack** format and these are the main packages you need to install beforehand:
```bash
npm install nodemon
npm install mongoose
npm install express
npm install react
npm install axios
npm install git
```
You will find the rest of the packages we installed in the **package.json** file, one includes the frontend packages and the other includes the backend packages.
## How to Run
In order to run the code you need to write the following commands in your terminal:

(to run the backend)
```bash
npm run server
```
(to run the frontend)
```bash
npm run start
```
You will be redirected to your default search engine on your computer, Google Chrome for example, with the website up and running.
